<!--class attribute is really is used to name elements basically, just so there are more than one h3 tag and we only need to change the color of one of the h3 so that one will nemed with the class attribute and then we can target that attribute specifically-->
<!--differnent type of elements  or tags can be targeted at the same time using a same class name-->
<!--id attribut works similar to class selector but one id name can be attributed to only on element rather than like class in whcih a sigle name of the class can be  attributed to different elements -->
<!--if id attribute is to be targetted we need to put # before the name of the id before targetting it-->
<!--to select a paricular set of element which have given attribute it can be targgetted like this "p[attribute name]"-->
