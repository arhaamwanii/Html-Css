        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="text1" style="font-size: 18px;">
            Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, one of South Africa's capital cities.[7][8] Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[9][10] His mother, Maye Musk (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[11][12][13] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer, who partly owned a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.[14][15][16][17] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[13][18]
    <br><br>
            Musk's family was wealthy during his youth.[17] His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[7] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane.[19][20][21] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his father.[9] Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[22] He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.[19][23]
    <br> <br>        
            Maye Musk has said of her son that he "was shy and awkward at school" and "didn't have many friends".[24] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[25] At age twelve, he sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[26][27]
    <br>    
          <h3>Education  </h3>
          <br>

            Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa.
        <br>
            Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and Pretoria Boys High School, from where he graduated.[28] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,[29][30] knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.[31] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[32]
    <br>
            Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[33] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber mill.[34] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[35][36] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School.[37][38][39][40] Although Musk claims he earned the degrees in 1995, UPenn maintains it awarded them in 1997.[41] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[42]
    <br>     
    <br>
            In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[43][44] In 1995, he was accepted to a PhD program in materials science at Stanford University.[45][46] However, Musk decided to join the Internet boom, dropping out two days after being accepted and applied for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[47][29]

In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Zip2.[48][49] Errol Musk provided them with $28,000 in funding.[50] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[51] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[52] with Musk coding the website every night.[52] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[42] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[53] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[54] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[55][56] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[57]

X.com and PayPal
Main articles: X.com (bank), PayPal, and PayPal Mafia
Later in 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[58] X.com was one of the first federally insured online banks, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[59] Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[60]
<br><br>
In 2000, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[52][60][61] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[62] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[63] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[64][b] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[66][67]
<br>
In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million.[68][69] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its "sentimental value".[70][71] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating "X, the everything app".[72]

In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[73] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[74] and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[74] With $100 million of his own money,[75] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.[76][77]
<br>
SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[78] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA Administrator (and former SpaceX consultant[79]) Mike Griffin later that year.[80][81] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[78] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[82] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[83] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[84]

Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on an inland platform.[85] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[86] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[87][88] Since 2019,[89] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.[90] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[91]

In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[92] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[93] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.[94][c] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.[97][98][99]
<br><br>
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.[100] However, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself "a free speech absolutist".[101][102] In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80 million. After asking the United States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine,[103] Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400 million.[104][105][106]

<h2>Tesla</h2>

Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[107] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[108] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[109]
<br><br>
Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[110][page needed][111] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[112] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[113][114] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[115] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to "Technoking" while retaining his position as CEO.[116]
<br>

Tesla began delivery of an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[117] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[118] A cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.[119] A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[120] The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[121][122] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020.[123] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.[124] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[125]
<br>
Since its initial public offering in 2010,[126] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[127][128] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[129][130] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.[131] In November 2021, Musk proposed, on Twitter, to sell 10% of his Tesla stock, since "much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance".[132] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week,[132] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[133] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Elon and Kimbal Musk were under investigation by the SEC for possible insider trading related to the sale.[134] In 2022, Musk unveiled a robot developed by Tesla, Optimus.[135] On June 20, 2023, Musk met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York City, suggesting that he might be interested in investing in India "as soon as humanly possible".[136]
<br>
SEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets
In 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet claiming that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[137][d] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[137][141][142] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[143] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[144][145] In April 2022, the shareholder who sued Musk over the tweet, along with several Tesla shareholders, said that a federal judge had ruled that the tweet was false, although the ruling in question has not been unsealed.[146] In February 2023, the jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[147]
<br>
In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[148] The SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet; the accusation was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.[149] The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.[150] In 2020, a judge prevented a lawsuit from proceeding that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price ("too high imo") violated the agreement.[151][152] FOIA-released records showed that the SEC itself concluded Musk has subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding "Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price".[153]

Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[154] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[155] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[156] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[157][158]

Tesla acquired SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price. At the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[159] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, claiming that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[160][161] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[162][163] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[164]

<h2>Neuralink</h2>

<br>In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100 million.[165][166] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain to facilitate its merging with machines. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[166][167] The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.[168]
<br>
In 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[165] He is listed as the sole author of an October 2019 paper that details some of Neuralink's research,[169] although Musk's being listed as such rankled the Neuralink team's researchers.[170] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as "a Fitbit in your skull" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[171][172][173] with MIT Technology Review describing them as "highly speculative" and "neuroscience theater".[171] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[168] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[174]
<br>
Neuralink has conducted further animal testing on macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis' Primate Research Center. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink's animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act.[175] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[176]

<br>In 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[177][178] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.[179] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[180]
<br><br>
Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[181][182] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[183] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[184] In 2021, tunnel construction was approved for Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[185]

<br>https://sec.gov/Archives/edgar...

<br>April 14, 2022[186]
<br>
<br>Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[187] and had previously questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech.[188][189] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[190] making him the largest shareholder.[191][e] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 IPO.[193] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[194][195] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share.[191][196] In response, Twitter's board adopted a "poison pill" shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.[197] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[198] This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.[199][200]
<br>
Tesla's stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal, causing Musk to lose around $30 billion of his net worth.[201][202] He subsequently tweeted criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's policies to his 86 million followers, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.[203] Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was "on hold" following a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts,[204] causing Twitter shares to drop more than 10 percent.[205] Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[206] he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's Board of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.[207] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.[208] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[209] The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.[210]
<br>
<br>Immediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal;[210][211] Musk became the CEO instead.[212] He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a "blue check",[213][214][215] and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff.[216][217] Musk lessened content moderation,[218] and in December, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.[219] The Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists,[220] and a study of millions of tweets following the acquisition indicated that hate speech on the platform has become "more visible" under Musk's leadership.[221]
<br>
<br>Within the first weeks of ownership, Musk made a series of decisions and changes that he quickly reversed, including the paid blue checkmark,[222] creating an "official" label[223] and forbidding linking to one's profiles on other social media platforms.[224] Under Musk's management, Twitter experienced several large scale outages.[225]
<br>
<br>In April 2022, The Washington Post reported that Musk privately claimed that supposed censorship on the platform, including the banning of accounts such as The Babylon Bee, had prompted him to begin the acquisition. The New York Post revealed that Musk's ex-wife Talulah Riley had encouraged Musk to purchase Twitter, specifically citing the Bee's ban.[226] Following the acquisition, he made reinstatement of accounts like the Bee an immediate priority.[227] The Independent reported that Musk has "appealed to far-right activists and influencers and unleashed a wave of hate speech and abuse aimed at LGBT+ people" since taking control of Twitter.[228]
<br>
<br>On December 18, Musk posted a poll to his Twitter account asking users to decide whether he should step down as the head of Twitter, with 57.5% out of the more than 17.5 million votes supporting that decision.[229] Musk then announced that he would resign as CEO "as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job".[230]
<br>
<br>On May 11, 2023, Musk announced that he would be stepping down from the CEO position and instead moving to "exec chair & CTO, overseeing product, software & sysops" and announced the new CEO, former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino.[231][232]

<br>Musk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a "nano-manager".[234] The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist.[235] Musk does not make formal business plans;[235] instead, he says he prefers to approach engineering problems[non sequitur] with an "iterative design methodology" and "tolerance for failures".[236] He has forced employees to adopt the company's own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot. His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket,[237] vertical integration has caused many usability problems for Tesla's software.[234]

<br>Musk's handling of employees—whom he communicates with directly through mass emails—has been characterized as "carrot and stick", rewarding those "who offer constructive criticism" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.[238][239][240] Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes for 80 hours per week.[241] He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees,[242][243] such as during the Model 3 "production hell" in 2018.[243] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla's workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.[244] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[245]

Musk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[234] and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as "show[ing] a lack of human understanding."[240][246] The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[247] The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as "self-driving", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer "lives at risk", with some employees resigning in consequence.[248]
