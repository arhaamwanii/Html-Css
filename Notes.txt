REM = root em, it is used to define its size relative to the root element which is typically html element
FONT WEIGHT = Boldness or thickness of the Text
    -it can also be relative to the parent typically using the keywork BOLDER or LIGHTER   
    -LIGHTER = -100
    -BOLDER = +100
FONT TYPE = X , Y , Z 
    -They are seperated by the commas because they may be present on some devices and not present on some
    -"" in case of spaces in the name of the font family we simply can writw it in spaces we have to include it in Quiotatiions
TEXT-ALIGN = it is used to align text 
    -it is only applicable on text elements
    -using it on a div which conatins both text and non text elements it will only effect text elements
CHROME DEVLOPER TOOLS - they help you to get stuff done(CSS) 



EACH element is Box in of Itslef (WIDTH & HEIGHT)
    -it can be changed using the pxx for reffernece 
    -or it can be changed by using %(i,e percent of the screen)
BODER = 1(THICKESS OF TH LINE IS IS MADE UP OF,Box exands outward), 2(STYLE OF THE BOREDER), 3(COLOUR OF THE BORDER)
    -BORDER WIDTH = UPPER, RIGHT SIDE, LOWER SIDE. LEFT SIDE
    -BORDER-TOP,LEFT,RIGHT,BOTTOM = CAN DO THE SAME THING BUT IT DOES IT INDIVIDUALLY
PADDING - PUSH'S BORDER OUT BT THE VALUE 
MARGIN - POSITON OUTSIDE THE BORDER, DISTANCE FROM TWO ELEMENT  
    -this is what the recangular structures in the chrome developer tools represent
    -maring -> border -> padding -> width and height

CONTENT DIV ELEMENT - INVIISIBLE
    -GROUPS ELEMENTS TOGETHER




IN ORDER TO ADD A FAVICON... 
Link it in the tile of the html 
give it relation as icon (rel="icon")
then refference it in the to its location in the files(heref="./hello.jpg")
//doing this much only will also add the favicon 
adding type attribte, it helps it to be compatible woth other browsers also


CASCASDING = how are rules applied in css(on a+ single element)
    
    -order of rules
    -FIRST LEVEL= external css -  least priortized 
    -SECOND LEVEL = internal - 
    -THIRRD LEVEL = inline - most priortized 

POSITION OF RULE(WHICH IS PZED FIRST)\
    -the lower down in a cascade a property is the more imporant it is
    -   color: blue;
        color: red(this one will be applied)


SPECIFICITY(which tagets over other )
    -ORDER OF SPECIFITY
        ID(most spcifific) > ATTRIBUTE > CLASS > ELEMENT(least spectfic)

IMPORTANT KEYWORD
    -where ever you put this keywork it will automatically priortize that attribute over all the othr attributed in the whole document
    -it dosent matter after this what the origianl specifity of the element was

#css can be added to a bunch of elements together, by grouping them before adding css to them seperated by comma
#child = one level down(needs to be seperated by space)
#specifiity = we can target a element first then add class and id for specifity in order to make it target that one specific elment only
    -(h1.hello#name)      -this means we are targetting element which has a  class name(hello) and a id of(name)
    -there should be no space in between 
    -first item should be the element in this case 



                                                    POSITONING

1. STATIC
    -default
    -continious in the flow just, element or div just next to the previous POSITION
    -adding of different attributes to chnage its position wont do any thing 

2. RELATIVE
    -realtive to origianl(static)
    -we can move it relatively

3. ABSOLUTE
    -relative to most recent anscestor(i.e postion of the most recent ancestor that ancestor should have position set manually) 
    -if there is no recent ancestor with postion set then it will be with respect to the upper left corner
    <Z INDEX - Z AXIS>
        -VERY THIN HAS A "Z AXIS " BY DEFAULT OF ZERO
        -WE CAN MAKE ONE ELEMENT HOVER OVER THE OTHER ELEMENT

4. FIXED
    - relative to the top left corner of the webpage
    -it wil not move when we move/scroll the browser horizontally or vertically
    -it is fixed on a single point



                                        DISPLAY

appbrewery.github.io/css-display/

1. BLOCK
    - full width BLOCK it will take the whole horizontal of that element 
    -next element will go below 
    - we can change the height and width of the block element 

2.INLINE
    -it is used to add two  different elements in a single line
    -are elements that do not start on a new line but instead flow alongside the surrounding content or other inline elements.
    -you cant change the height and width of the inline display
    -<span>

3.INLINE BLOCK
    -we can chamge the height and width of the element and can determine how much of the horizontal and vertical space occupied by it

4. NONE
    -

SPAN ELEMENT - element has display set to inline by default
            - it is used to add atrribute to  very specific part of the text or something else which is already present in an element



                                        FLOAT

You're essentially taking it out of the normal document flow and positioning it to the left or right of its containing element.

LEFT
    -this pushes the element the left 
    -rest of the content will flow to the right of the screen 

RIGHT 
    -this will push the element to the right 
    -rest of the content will flow towards the right of the screen

NONE 
    -this is its value by the default i.e it will occupy the whole vertical  row

<>To prevent a element form going with this flow clear property can be used 
    - clear : left;
        OR
    - clear : right;    (left and right)





                                            RESPONSIVE(CSS)

-RESPONSIVE in terms of screen size change when you change a screen size the elements on the screen also change respectvelly
-manly of 4 types
    1. MEDIA QUERRY 
    2.CSS GRID = forms 2d grids
    3.CSS FLEXBOX = mainly used for one D formation 
    4.EXTENAL FRAMEWORKS(eg BOOTSTRAP)
    <FRAME WORK = EXTERNAL>


                                            MEDIA QUERRIES

@media (max-width: 600px) {
   Styles that apply to all media types when the screen width is 600px or narrower 
}

- () has the breakpoint to apply the css given  in the{}
- is basically an if statement for css
- screen keyoword > only target screen 
- print keywod > target print settings

<these statement make the page automatically responsive because if oe chnages all the othe will change accordinglly>




                                                        WEBSITE LAYOUT

table element - <tabel>             should specically be used to create text related categories it should not be used to create layouts
float = shoud mainly be used to wrap the text around an elemment it should also not be used to create layouts

                                                         FLEXBOX(layout system)

-display flex (inline Flex)

        -this is mainly added to the container containg all the elements that you want to layout using the Flexbox
        -this property overlies all the inline, block and inline block 
        -first aligns elements horizonatally by DEFAULT
        -which will be a block by default(it will occupy the whole horizontal)
        -we can set it to "inline block " 

MODIFYING FLEXBOX 

        -FLEX-DIRECTION: ROW(horizontal) - default - the flex axis will be in the horizontal axis/cross axis vertical
        -FLEX-DIRECTION: COLUMN(vertical) - the main axis will be in the vertical DIRECTION/cross axix horizontal

        -FLEX BASIS(height) - it takes place along the main axis, thus it increases different things in ROWS and  COLUMNS


" > " this is used to select the direct childern of a selector, it wont select the inner child

-Layout 

        ORDER: defines its postion of elemnent from the group - starts from 0
        FLex-Wrap:(Parent)
            -wrap: this will make the rest of the elemets shift to the next line
            -no wrap: (Default) it will keep going horizonatally
        
        JUSTIFY CONTENT: shifts content along the main axis 
            -flex start 
            -flex end
            -centre
            -space between: no space between the ends equal sapace between the elements   
            -space around
            -space evenly

        ALIGN CONTENT: aligns content along the cross axic

SIZING

PRIORITY LIST: 
-min/maximum width > flex basis> Width> contnetwidth
     -default max width: text length 
     -default min width: biggest word length 

GROW AND SHRINK
-most of flexiniliy comes from this
-setting it to none(0) = the items dont change there size at all when there is change in the display
    -FLEX GROW: occupy all of the hoaronatal space and cover it up 
        it is off(0) by default

    -FLEX SHRINK: items shift, to the next line when the space is shrunk resulting into dicrease in width
        it is on by deafult
    

#short form for flex grow , flex shrink, flex basis 
    flexx: x y z;

    here x = flex grow
    y = flex shrink 
    z = flex basis

    flex: 1; == means grow 1 shrink one flex basis 0 



                            GRID 
used to create 2d layouts
GENRALLY 
    FLEX BOX IS GOOD FOR ONE D
    GRID IS GOOD FOR TWO 2 compared to flex
    (combination of these two is often used)



                                BOOTSTRAP

INCLUDING BOOTSTRAP CSS
->using cdn link(content delivery Network)
->Usign an internal style element will override external css - overide css

BOOTSTRAP layout(Class)
    >container Fluid = edge to edge behavior
    >container = not edge to edge rather equal spacing

-we can think of each of our rows having 12 columns

SIZED COLUMN 
    >col-(1to12) will alocate that much of the full row to that DIV - percentage based

BREAK-POINTS 
    -these differentiate the size of colum for different devices,
    -basically we can add media querries like stuff, if the device screen size is 1000px or less then change the colum ratio to 2 insted of 3 
    

    -Small "sm" -- it is mainly used in small devises
    -medium "md" -- for screen sizes which ae smaller than half the size of the screen of this monitor
   
    -small - mobile (sm)
    -medium - tablets and ipands (md)
    -large - laptop (lg)
    -extra large - desktop (xl)
    -exta extra large - tv (xxl)

    col class by default is going to take 100% of the width
    (col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4)
    on smaller divises we make things bigger

BOOT-STRAP COMPONENTS
    -Button: check out the docs
    
BOOTSTRAP-SPACING 
    -PADDING(it is the space between the margin and the components of that element)
    -propert{side}-{size}

    -m - for classes that set margin
    -p - for classes that set padding

    t - for classes that set margin-top or padding-top
    b - for classes that set margin-bottom or padding-bottom
    l - for classes that set margin-left or padding-left
    r - for classes that set margin-right or padding-right
    x - for classes that set both *-left and *-right
    y - for classes that set both *-top and *-bottom

    SIZE CAN BE SET - BY NUMBERS
    

    0 - for classes that eliminate the margin or padding by setting it to 0
    1 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * .25
    2 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * .5
    3 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer
    4 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 1.5
    5 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 3
    auto - for classes that set the margin to auto

                                                            JAVA-SCRIPT
-java script is a interpeted languge

-alert("message")
    -alert here is the function   (behavior)
    -";" denotes the end of the fontion - statement terminator
    -A piece of text is mainy representes by -double quotation "" - STRING
        -this is very nnecessary and this is what differnentate the text from the code 

-DATA TYPE 
    -STRING = text
    -NUEBER = number
    -BOOLEYAN = yes no 

-VARIABLES
    -remember stuff

    - var myName = "arham" ;
        -var  - KEYWORD
        -my name - name of the VARIABLE
        -arham - value in it

    - var -- means you can vary the data which is insdie the variable

    - "a = b" , asigns the value  of b to a 
    in this code what happens is that value of "b" is assigned to "a" 
    i,e a has been given the value of b
    i.e a is b " to remember this, = can be thought of as is
    basically "a is b"

VARIABLE -- CONVENTIIONS
    - try to give it meaning full name
    -var cant begin with number
    -cant contain spaces

    -js uses camel casing in its synatax
    
STRINGS
    -primitie data type
    -"a" + "b" it becomes "ab"
    -length calculation = variable.length
    
    -if you want to do some calculation or something dont do it in the function make a seperate variable where you can do that then out in the variable
    
    -command / will turn the code in to a comment

    -SLICiNG STRING - "variable.slice(from(0),to(1))" -- this will slice the first charecter of the string not including the second one

    -CHANGING THE CHARECTERS
    -"variable.toUppecase()"

Calculation in Js are pretty Straight Forward
    -everything basically function the same as before except for mudulo

    -In MODULO(%) - the sign is %
    -it function is that it allows us to see the remainder once a calculation is done
    -it can be used to determine weather the number is even or is it odd


    -try to make the bodmass rules obvious

INCREMENT AND DECREMENT - operators in js
    -"X++" increament in the value of x by one
    -increment expression 
    -"x--" dicreses values by one 
    -dicrement expression 

    -"x+=3" this means that you are adding x by the value of 3


CREATING AND CALLING FUNCTION
    -robot, given instructions in code
    -packet of code with a name
    -variable for code
    -seperation of logic
    -can change the parameter
    -basically it is a black box which takes an input and gives an output accordingly
     

    -PARAMETERS - they act as local variables 

    function name(){
        code 
        code
    }

    calling a function - "
        
        name();"

FUNCTIONS ARE OF THREE TYPES 
    -Simple Function 
    -INPUT IN FUNCTION, this input is then going to be used in the considere
        basically you create a varible in the biging of the function and use it in the code then when you call the function you determine the value of this variable
    -Function also gives output
        "return",
        - if you want the function to return some value, and you want to use it outside you can return it out of the function 
        -once the value is out there you need to store it in a variable or something to make it applicabel outside the function as well
        -once you call a function - "name(a,b)" you are actually calling for the function to do whatever it has inside of it once that is dome, you may need to return  the value of that thats when the value of return is used
        -a & b are the values which are assigned to the local variables inside the function(value of parameters)
        - it is necessary to store the value of the item in a container outside to make  a use of it
        
-Math
    -M is capitalized
    -Math.random = generates a random number between 0 and 1 -- floating number i.e in deciamls

 IF ELSE CONDITONAL --- logic  
    -control the flow
    -IF -> {}it is the main condiitiom 
    -ELSE -> it the the secondary  code which will be executed if the condition fo if not correct
        -else should be the last thing to go for- everything rest leaving what you put in if and else if
COMPRATIVES IN Js
    -compare values
    - "===" to check wheter left hand side to right han d SIDE
        - in case of "==" it checks for equality but it dosent check for dosent check for equality of data type 
        -strict equator vs equalor

    -"!==" to check if it is  not Equal
    -">" check greter than
    -">=" greater than or equal 


    - if you want to check if x is equal to 11 or 13, it should come before checking if x is greater than 12 or less than 12

COMBINING COMPIRATORS
    -   AND (&&) and OR (||)

ARRAYS 
    -it is a collection of like or unlike Data types
    -[COLLECTION OF DATA]

    -var Eggs = eggs[1];

    -accessing a array => Eggs[2]

    -Eggs.length

    -square braces [] - access and create desk

    -PUSH
    -it can be used to push  a item at the end of an array

    -POP
    it is used to pop the items in the array - at the end

LOOPS 
    -while(something is true), this means that while this statement is true do something
    -for

ADDING JS 
    -Inline atribute "on load" - put inside the double quotations- (we can then incorpirate the strings of js in single quotations ) - dont use it
    - SCRIPT TAG - its location metters a lot because as go in sequence if it comes before something which is later on in the it wont work and will throw in an error
        -it is consisdered good practise to put it at the end as it also takes compiratively more time to load upper
    -"js files


DOCOUNENT OBJECT MODEL(DOM)

    - it is used to manuplate html using JavaScript
    -catalogs the website into individual objects which can be selected 
    -inner Html

    -we can modify the code, by first creating a varible for the locationof the element we want to afect with javascript;

    -OBJECTS INSIDE THE DOM CAN HAVE    
        -PROPERTIES = define somethinf aboout the project
            -

        -METHODS = things an object can do
            -


    GETTER      (car.COLOR) 
    -used to get a property of a object

    SETTER       (car.numberofDoor = 0 ;)
    -just a difference of = between setter and getter
    - it is used to edit stuff
    -

    CALLING A METHODS
    -car.drive();
    -only difference between a method and an obeect is that method is something applicable to objects
    -it is basically function for an object
    -we know something we do something

    -Methods are essentially FUNCTIONS 
    -BUTTON
    -properties - inner html, style , first child
    -methods - click(), append Child(), setattribute().

    all of this can be accessed using the dot notation

    -document.getElementByTagName("li)
        -this will select all the lits items
        -it wont just fetch one all the elements with the name li
        -gives back an array 
        
        -we cant just chnage the properties of a array
        - we have to select the array one by one 
    
    -getElement by class
        -is also going to give back an array
        -basically it will return an array with all the elements having the given class
    



    -get elemeent by id 
        -is the the one that can dirctly select one of the ELEMENTS
        -selects singular

    querry selectors - in this case we can specify what we wan to do and do shit accordingly
        - # for an ID
        - . for an class
        - simple tag name to select the whole thing

        or you can a numebr of tose to be more specific

        - it  

MANUPATING VIA JS
    -document.querySelector("h1").style.color = "blue";
    -properties may difference
    #keep in mind the camel casing

    IN MOST  OF THE CASES CAPITILOZATION WILL TAKE PLACE INSTEAD OF SPACES IN THE ACTUAL CSS
    -"" we have to specify thigns as a string in js - even if it is a number


SEPERATION OF CONCERNS 
    -HTML - content
    -CSS - style - looking
    -JS - behavior - behaving

CLASS LIST
    -you can acess the calss list then you can toggle it on or off 
    -document.getElementById("head").classList.toggle("remove");
    

    -classList.add = adds the class to that element
    -classList.remove =  removes the class from that element
    -classList.toggle = if alternates the class if it is off it turns it off it is on and vise versa

    this is how you only conrol the css and not effect the actuall css

    -document.getElementById("one").classList.add("huge");

TEXT-MANUPPLATION
    -inner.html = you will get the whole html includig the text
    -content.html = it only gets the text 

ATTRIBUTE MANUPLATION
    -EG: href, class itself
    -document.getElementById("attributes").attributes;
    -this shows all the atributes of the given element
    -document.getElementById("attributes").getAttribute("href");
    - this will give the value of the attribute of the given element


ADDING OR REMOVING EVENT LISTNERS
    -addEvenListner
    -it
